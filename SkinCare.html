                Skin care is a range of practices that support skin integrity,
                enhance its appearance, and relieve skin conditions.
                They can include nutrition, avoidance of excessive sun exposure,
                and appropriate use of emollients.
                Practices that enhance appearance include the use of cosmetics, botulinum,
                exfoliation, fillers, laser resurfacing, microdermabrasion, peels,
                retinol therapy, and ultrasonic skin treatment.
                Skin care is a routine daily procedure in many settings,
                such as skin that is either too dry or too moist,
                and prevention of dermatitis and prevention of skin injuries.
                Skin care is a part of the treatment of wound healing,
                radiation therapy and some medications.

                    <p>
                        The first recorded proof of a skincare regimen was found in Egypt in 3000 BCE.
                        Natural, readily available items like olive oil, ostrich eggs,
                        dough and essential oils made from herbs and plants were
                        used to address skin concerns of all types.

            <h2>Kind of acids</h2>
            <p>
                The idea that there‚Äôs acid in your skin-care products may sound scary.
                In reality, they‚Äôre game-changers in the quest to achieve smooth,
                even-toned, and radiant skin.
                These acids may be alpha hydroxy acids or AHAs (like glycolic or lactic),
                beta hydroxy acid or BHA (like salicylic),
                or act as skin brighteners (like ellagic) to chase
                away dark spots from too much sun exposure.
                Knowing exactly what acids are in your products and how they work can help
                you find the right mix of anti-agers to build the
                routine that delivers the results you‚Äôre after

            <h2>Sunscreen</h2>
            <p>
                Wearing sunscreen is one of the best
                ‚Äî and easiest ‚Äî
                ways to protect your skin's appearance and health at any age.
                Used regularly, sunscreen helps prevent sunburn,
                skin cancer and premature aging.<br>
                In general,
                you should reapply sunscreen every two hours
                for consistent protection. However,
                there is an exception to the rule‚Äîif you're
                sweating or swimming you need to apply more often.
                To make sure you're protected even when you're active,
                you should reapply sunscreen at least every 80 minutes
